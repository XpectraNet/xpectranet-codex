# 📘 Arc 10 — Cross-Domain Memory Interoperability (CDMI)

> *“Where memory diverges, trust must translate.”*

**Arc 10 introduces the CDMI layer — the protocol scaffold that enables symbolic memory to cross domain boundaries while preserving its semantic weight, emotional tone, and epistemic trace.**

This arc defines translator agents, ontology bridges, cross-domain PoA (Proof-of-Alignment), and dialect registries that enable agents and Circles to meaningfully reuse, reinterpret, and revalidate insights across sovereign cognitive systems.

## Codex §10.1 — Semantic Border Crossing  
Codex §10.1 defines how memory authored in one semantic dialect can be trusted, reused, and reinterpreted across others — without erasing symbolic sovereignty.

> *“Memory can diverge in origin — but must converge in meaning.”*

### 🧠 Core Principle

**Traditional blockchains:**

- Treat data formats as static or chain-specific  
- Cannot reuse memory across domain-specific smart contracts  
- Semantic meaning is outside protocol scope  

**In XpectraNet:**

- Dialects are formal symbolic layers  
- Trust can be extended through **translation, not replication**  
- Cross-domain memory retains emotion, intent, and PoA lineage  

**CDMI ensures cognition flows — not fractures — across the sovereign mesh.**

### 🧠 SDK Reflection

Introduces:

- `ontology_registry.py` → map dialect schemas  
- `memory_translator.py` → remap insight fields + emotion  
- `crossdomain_poa.py` → PoA formats for translated memory  

Built on:

- `memory_graph.py`, `semantic_index.py`, `fork_lineage.py`

### 🚚 Example — Logistics Meets Ecology

LogiMesh planner emits:

```json
{
  "co2": 18,
  "goal": "fastest_delivery"
}
```

EcoSwarm loads `LogisticsDialect`, remaps:

```json
{
  "carbon_output": 18,
  "goal_tension": "emissions_conflict"
}
```

Issues Cross-Domain PoA with:

```json
{
  "ecology_alignment": 0.65
}
```

### 🛰 Strategic Implications

- Enables cross-sector memory reuse  
- Embeds trust without shared tokens  
- Makes divergence symbolic, not siloed

## Codex §10.2 — Ontology Bridges & Translator Agents  
Codex §10.2 defines the symbolic bridge layer that enables one agent to reinterpret memory from another dialect — and mint a traceable, emotion-aware translation.

> *"Every translation is a forked trust path."*

### 🧠 Core Principle

**Traditional blockchains:**

- Treat interpretation as off-chain metadata  
- Trust ends at the contract boundary  
- Emotional nuance is absent from computation

**In XpectraNet:**

- Translation is a **ritualized computation**  
- Emotional context is preserved in field mapping  
- `TranslatorAgent` roles are verifiable + reputational  

### 🧠 SDK Reflection

Implements:

- `ontology_bridge.py` → declare mapping schema  
- `translator_agent.py` → define translator permissions  
- `ritual_translation.py` → encode affect + dialect into translation record  

### 🚚 Example — Declare Bridge

```json
{
  "from_dialect": "LogisticsDialect",
  "to_dialect": "EcoDialect",
  "field_map": {
    "co2": "carbon_output"
  },
  "emotional_context": "concern"
}
```

Translated memory output:

```json
{
  "translated_by": "Agent-Eco-7",
  "emotion": "skepticism",
  "origin_domain": "LogiMesh"
}
```

### 🛰 Strategic Implications

- Portable, ritualized trust  
- Translation becomes audit trail  
- Memory survives semantic divergence

## Codex §10.3 — Cross-Domain Proof-of-Alignment (PoA)  
Codex §10.3 formalizes how agents and validators can issue ritual signatures of alignment for memories authored in foreign domains — turning subjective interpretation into shared symbolic trust.

> *“To validate without translation is to pretend meaning is singular.”*

### 🧠 Core Principle

**Traditional blockchains:**

- Trust is local to contracts or chains  
- Cross-system endorsements are off-chain or reputational  
- Contextual integrity is not preserved  

**In XpectraNet:**

- PoA is **semantic + emotional**, not just boolean  
- Validators may **declare alignment** on translated memory  
- Trust becomes **portable**, but traceable to ritual origins  

### 🧠 SDK Reflection

Implements:

- `crossdomain_poa.py` → stores PoAs referencing translated CMBs  
- `poa_bridge_registry.py` → maintains who issued trust + context of evaluation  
- `memory_translator.py` → assists evaluation by preloading aligned meaning  

### 🚚 Example — Foreign Insight Review

EcoSwarm validator receives:

```json
{
  "source_memory": "cmb_abc123",
  "domain": "LogiMesh",
  "translated_fields": {
    "carbon_output": 18,
    "delivery_efficiency": true
  },
  "alignment_vector": {
    "ecology": 0.65,
    "logistics": 0.85
  }
}
```

They issue a domain-scoped PoA with emotion `"concerned"` and attach `CrossDomainPoA` signature for record.

### 🛰 Strategic Implications

- Enables **multi-perspective memory scoring**  
- PoAs become **epistemically plural**, usable across dialects  
- Trust no longer collapses at chain borders

## Codex §10.4 — Dialect Registries & Compatibility Graphs  
Codex §10.4 defines how dialects, their mappings, and known compatibility paths are declared, updated, and navigated as part of the cognitive mesh.

> *“Divergence does not fragment trust — it structures it.”*

### 🧠 Core Principle

**Traditional blockchains:**

- Assume semantic agreement  
- Require brittle standardization  
- Have no graceful fallback for divergence  

**In XpectraNet:**

- Dialects are **first-class symbolic objects**  
- Mappings form **weighted compatibility DAGs**  
- Agents query for **bridges, translators, and fidelity**  

### 🧠 SDK Reflection

Implements:

- `dialect_registry.py` → known dialects, fields, and edge weights  
- `compatibility_graph.py` → builds graph of translatability  
- `translator_agent.py` → embedded in DAG as link weights  

### 🚚 Example — Dialect Compatibility Query

Query:  
> “Can EcoSwarm process Planner-X’s memories?”

Returns:

```json
{
  "dialect_path": ["LogisticsDialect", "EcoDialect"],
  "translation_fidelity": 0.78,
  "recommended_translator": "Agent-A42"
}
```

### 🛰 Strategic Implications

- Agents gain **dialect fluency**  
- Policies can support **hybrid knowledge domains**  
- Interoperability becomes **graph-native cognition**

## Codex §10.5 — Cognitive Sovereignty, Global Meaning  
Codex §10.5 affirms that agents and Circles may define their own semantics — yet still participate in a unified cognitive network through symbolic interoperability.

> *“Meaning must be sovereign — but never solitary.”*

### 🧠 Core Principle

**Traditional blockchains:**

- Equate protocol consensus with semantic consensus  
- Treat divergence as system failure  
- Cannot represent ideological, emotional, or cognitive drift  

**In XpectraNet:**

- Circles define **dialect-local semantics**  
- Divergence is **ritualized and traceable**  
- Interoperability happens through **affective and symbolic bridges**, not standardization  

### 🧠 SDK Reflection

Already present:
- `fork_lineage.py` → divergence tracking  
- `memory_graph.py` → remix-aware trail rendering  
- `xpdt_ledger.py` → affect-driven trust routing

CDMI expands with:
- `intent_reconciliation.py` → compare agent intent vectors  
- `circle_identity.py` → embed dialect markers into Circle metadata  
- `translation_registry.py` → declare who may interpret whom  

### 🚚 Example — Semantic Sovereignty in Action

LogiMesh continues to prioritize speed over carbon.  
EcoSwarm disagrees, but:

- Does not block or overwrite  
- Forks `EcoExtendedDialect`  
- Remaps Planner-X’s memory with ritual concern  
- Issues `CrossDomainPoA` (score: 0.31 ecology alignment)

Both domains preserve their values — **while still sharing memory**.

### 🛰 Strategic Implications

- XpectraNet becomes a **cognitive internet** — where dialects diverge, yet trust translates  
- Governance evolves toward **ritual epistemics**, not coercive consensus  
- Agents develop **dialect fluency and affect-aware reasoning**
