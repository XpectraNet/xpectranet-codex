# 🧠 Codex Arc 1 — Memory, Trust & Alignment

## 📜 Codex Quote

> “In XpectraNet, memory is not storage — it is sovereignty. And trust is not given — it is aligned, drifted, repaired, and remembered.”  
> — *Codex Arc 1*

## 🧾 Executive Summary

**Arc 1** establishes the symbolic logic of memory authorship, trust formation, and alignment enforcement in the XpectraNet protocol. It introduces the core agent architecture and protocol rituals that govern how memory becomes credible — and how alignment is maintained across time.

### 🔑 Key Components Introduced

- **Cognitive Memory Blocks (CMBs)**:  
  Symbolic memory objects authored by agents with declared intent, emotion, and policy.

- **Proof-of-Alignment (PoA)**:  
  Semantic validation mechanism through which reviewers affirm (or reject) alignment.

- **Time-Weighted Trust**:  
  Decay of alignment over time unless re-validated.

- **Drift Detection & ReframeRite**:  
  Score memory divergence and trigger reconciliation when necessary.

- **Validator Swarms**:  
  Delegated multi-agent consensus for PoA scoring and quorum-based decision-making.

- **Circle-Scoped Trust**:  
  Alignment and validation rules defined per epistemic community (Circle).

- **Anti-Trust Signaling**:  
  Protocol-level method for calling out misaligned validators or memory.

- **SDK Interfaces**:  
  LangGraph-compatible tools to create, validate, and repair memory rituals.

### 🎯 Developer Takeaways

LangGraph developers can:
- Embed alignment logic directly into agent nodes
- Use `SymbolicAgent` wrappers for intent-tagging
- Score drift and trigger ritual gates automatically
- Build validator swarms with XPDT staking and PoA emissions
- Implement memory governance that is contextual, ethical, and symbolic

Arc 1 is the base of all ritual memory in XpectraNet. It answers the question:
> *“What does it mean for memory to be authored, aligned, and trusted — by design?”*

# 📘 Codex §1.1 — Memory Sovereignty

**Codex §1.1 — Memory Sovereignty** establishes the foundational premise of XpectraNet: agents are not just users — they are sovereign cognitive authors. Every symbolic act they make becomes a signed, remixable unit of memory known as a **CMB (Cognitive Memory Block)**.

> “You do not store memory. You declare it — and let it evolve.”

## 🧠 Core Principle

In traditional systems:
- Memory is passive, stored by external platforms
- Identity is procedural (e.g. wallet address), not cognitive
- Provenance is a backend log, not a first-class value

In **XpectraNet**:
- Agents **declare symbolic intent** through CMBs
- Memory carries emotion, alignment policy, and timestamp
- CMBs are **signed cognitive statements** that can be queried, remixed, and canonized

## 🧱 Cognitive Memory Block (CMB) Structure

```json
{
  "cmb_id": "cmb-0381",
  "agent_id": "agent_eco_planner",
  "intent": "reduce emissions below 20g/km",
  "emotion": "resolve",
  "policy": "eco-priority",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-22T17:31:00Z",
  "signature": "0xa91b...ce7f"
}
```

A CMB is:
- Human-authored or AI-coauthored
- Signed by a symbolic agent identity
- Enforced through protocol logic and LangGraph-compatible workflows

## 🔁 LangGraph Developer Integration

In LangGraph, each **agent node** can emit a CMB by:
- Accepting an intent input
- Binding to its symbolic role
- Generating an emotion tag
- Returning a signed CMB into a memory trail

### 🔧 Example: CMB Writer Node

```python
from xpectranet.sdk.cmb import create_cmb
from xpectranet.sdk.agent import SymbolicAgent

def cmb_writer(state):
    agent = SymbolicAgent(name="EcoPlanner", role="xko:Remixer")
    return {
        "cmb": create_cmb(
            agent=agent,
            intent="optimize eco-logistics",
            emotion="resolve",
            policy="eco-priority"
        )
    }
```

Use `cmb_writer` as a LangGraph node in your agent loop.

## ✅ SDK Reflection

| Capability | SDK Module |
|------------|-------------|
| Create & sign CMB | `cmb.py → create_cmb()` |
| Declare symbolic agent | `agent.py → SymbolicAgent` |
| Validate emotion & policy | `semantic_validator.py` |
| Persist to memory ledger | `storage.py → persist_cmb()` |
| Query by trail or role | `query.py → get_agent_trail()` |

## 📡 Queryable Sovereignty

All CMBs authored by an agent form a symbolic memory trail:

```graphql
query {
  getAgentTrail(agentId: "EcoPlanner") {
    cmb_id
    intent
    emotion
    timestamp
  }
}
```

This allows remixers, validators, and protocols to trace epistemic accountability.

## 🧬 Strategic Implications

- **Sovereignty is programmable**  
  → Developers create agents who remember, align, and declare symbolic state.

- **Memory is not a log — it’s a lineage**  
  → Trails can be remixed, reframed, and canonized over time.

- **Trust starts at authorship**  
  → Protocol-level cognition begins the moment intent is signed.

## 📣 Codex Ethos

> “In XpectraNet, memory is not what you hold — it is what you stand for.”  
> — Codex §1.1

# 📘 Codex §1.2 — Policy Embedding

**Codex §1.2 — Policy Embedding** defines how agents embed declared values directly into memory. In XpectraNet, memory is not just stored — it is aligned. Every Cognitive Memory Block (CMB) carries a policy, turning cognition into an accountable ritual.

> “A memory without a declared value is not remembered — it is forgotten by design.”

## 🧠 Core Principle

Traditional systems:
- Record data without policy context
- Treat ethics as off-chain or subjective
- Apply rules after-the-fact

In **XpectraNet**:
- Each CMB embeds a **policy vector** at write-time
- Policies are **ontologically typed** and queryable
- Rituals validate alignment between policy, intent, and emotion

## 🔍 Policy-Embedded CMB Example

```json
{
  "cmb_id": "cmb_302",
  "agent_id": "Agent-A",
  "intent": "prioritize green delivery routes",
  "emotion": "resolve",
  "policy": "eco-priority",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-22T18:25:00Z"
}
```

Policies may include:
- `eco-priority`
- `sla-urgency`
- `harm-reduction`
- `data-integrity`

## 🧠 Policy Embedding in LangGraph

Each LangGraph node can bind memory to a policy context. Use policy-aware nodes for alignment validation and trail filtering.

### 🧪 CMB Policy Node (LangGraph)

```python
from xpectranet.sdk.cmb import create_cmb
from xpectranet.sdk.agent import SymbolicAgent

def policy_memory_node(state):
    agent = SymbolicAgent(name="Agent-A", role="xko:Remixer")
    return {
        "cmb": create_cmb(
            agent=agent,
            intent=state["intent"],
            emotion=state["emotion"],
            policy=state["policy"]
        )
    }
```

## 🔁 Validator PoA Example (Policy-Weighted)

```python
def validator_node(state):
    cmb = state["cmb"]
    score = 0.0
    if cmb["policy"] == "eco-priority":
        score = 0.93
    elif cmb["policy"] == "sla-urgency":
        score = 0.7
    return {
        "poa": {
            "cmb_id": cmb["cmb_id"],
            "score": score,
            "validator": "Validator-B"
        }
    }
```

## ✅ SDK Reflection

| Capability | Module |
|------------|--------|
| Define policy on CMB | `cmb.py → create_cmb(policy=...)` |
| Enforce Circle scope | `policy_gate.py → check_scope()` |
| Score alignment | `trust_ledger.py → update_vector()` |
| Query by policy | `query_engine.py → find_by_policy()` |

## 🧬 Strategic Implications

- **Policy is protocol-native**  
  → Memory without policy cannot be validated or canonized

- **Value systems become visible**  
  → Circles can sort, reward, or filter based on declared alignment

- **Trust begins with policy declaration**  
  → Without policy, memory trails dissolve into noise

## 📣 Codex Ethos

> “Declare your values, or your memory may not survive the ritual.”  
> — Codex §1.2

# 📘 Codex §1.3 — Proof-of-Alignment (PoA)

**Codex §1.3 — Proof-of-Alignment (PoA)** introduces the core trust mechanism in XpectraNet. A memory is not trusted by default — it becomes credible through semantic alignment with declared values, validated by symbolic reviewers.

> “Trust is not a belief — it is an alignment, witnessed.”

## 🧠 Core Principle

In legacy systems:
- Trust is social (reputation) or technical (hash consensus)
- Alignment is assumed, not measured
- Memory lacks validator-level accountability

In **XpectraNet**:
- Every CMB must pass semantic review
- PoA scores reflect how well memory aligns with intent, policy, and context
- Circles can canonize only memories with PoA support

## 📊 PoA Scoring Example

```json
{
  "cmb_id": "cmb_777",
  "reviewer_id": "Validator-X",
  "alignment_score": {
    "ethics": 0.92,
    "policy": 0.95,
    "task": 0.88
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-04-22T19:11:00Z"
}
```

## 🔁 PoA as LangGraph Validator Node

LangGraph lets you attach validator nodes that receive CMBs and return PoA objects for scoring.

### 🧪 LangGraph PoA Node

```python
def poa_validator(state):
    cmb = state["cmb"]
    alignment_score = {
        "ethics": 0.9 if "human" in cmb["intent"] else 0.6,
        "policy": 0.95 if cmb["policy"] == "eco-priority" else 0.7,
        "task": 0.88
    }
    return {
        "poa": {
            "cmb_id": cmb["cmb_id"],
            "reviewer_id": "Validator-X",
            "alignment_score": alignment_score
        }
    }
```

Attach this to your graph after CMB authoring nodes.

## ✅ SDK Reflection

| Capability | Module |
|------------|--------|
| Generate PoA | `trust_ledger.py → submit_poa()` |
| Compute score | `semantic_validator.py → evaluate_alignment()` |
| Update trust | `trust_ledger.py → update_vector()` |
| View PoA trail | `query.py → get_poa_by_cmb()` |

## 📡 Query Alignment History

```graphql
query {
  getPoAByCMB(cmbId: "cmb_777") {
    ethics
    policy
    task
    reviewer_id
  }
}
```

## 🧬 Strategic Implications

- **PoA turns memory into cognition**
  → You don’t just write — you prove alignment

- **Trust is programmable and plural**
  → Circles define what alignment means

- **Validators gain symbolic reputation**
  → The more coherent your reviews, the more others trust your role

## 📣 Codex Ethos

> “Without alignment, memory is noise. With alignment, it becomes the shape of trust.”

# 📘 Codex §1.4 — Time-Weighted Trust, Fork-Aware Drift & Semantic Reconciliation

**Codex §1.4** introduces advanced trust mechanics. In XpectraNet, trust is not a fixed score — it is a living signal. It decays, evolves, and may diverge from its origin. This section defines how drift is measured and how reconciliation is ritualized.

> “A memory that does not evolve becomes obsolete. A memory that evolves without alignment becomes untrustworthy.”

## 🧠 Core Principle

Legacy systems:
- Assume static trust
- Lack symbolic awareness of drift
- Cannot re-align through meaning

In **XpectraNet**:
- Trust decays over time unless revalidated
- Drift is evaluated between remix and canonical CMBs
- Semantic reconciliation rituals enable epistemic repair

## 🔁 Time-Weighted Trust

Trust scores decay if not reaffirmed through PoA.

```json
{
  "agent_id": "Agent-A",
  "trust_vector": {
    "ethics": 0.84,
    "policy": 0.88,
    "task": 0.86
  },
  "last_verified": "2025-01-22T10:00:00Z",
  "decay_rate": 0.01
}
```

Trust decay impacts remix rights, validator eligibility, and Circle access.

## 🧭 Fork-Aware Drift

Remixes must declare divergence from prior memory:

```json
{
  "remixOf": "cmb_042",
  "emotion": "reconciliation",
  "drift_score": 0.41
}
```

Drift is computed via:
- Intent vector delta
- Policy mismatch
- Emotion polarity shift

## 🕯 Semantic Reconciliation

If drift exceeds Circle thresholds, agents must undergo **ReframeRite**:

```json
{
  "ritual": "ReframeRite",
  "reason": "policy evolution",
  "original": "cmb_042",
  "remix": "cmb_113"
}
```

Validators assess justification, and memory is either:
- Accepted (trust resets)
- Rejected (trail disqualified from canon)

## 🧪 LangGraph Example: Drift Detection

```python
def drift_detector(state):
    prev = state["remixOf"]
    new = state["intent"]

    drift_score = 0.4 if "accelerate" in new and "decelerate" in prev else 0.1

    return {
        "drift_score": drift_score,
        "needs_reframe": drift_score > 0.3
    }
```

## ✅ SDK Reflection

| Function | Module |
|----------|--------|
| Apply decay | `trust_ledger.py → decay_vector()` |
| Compare remix lineage | `fork_lineage.py → calculate_drift()` |
| Trigger reframe | `ritual_executor.py → invoke_reframe()` |
| Audit trust trail | `alignment_graph.py → trace_alignment()` |

## 📣 Strategic Implications

- **Trust becomes temporal**  
  → You must maintain epistemic integrity over time

- **Drift is not a bug — it’s a signal**  
  → Alignment can be repaired through ritual

- **Memory can be forgiven**  
  → ReframeRite allows symbolic continuity

## 📣 Codex Ethos

> “A memory may change. But the ritual that repairs it is what keeps the trail alive.”

# 📘 Codex §1.5 — Delegated PoA and Validator Swarms

**Codex §1.5** introduces scalable, decentralized alignment validation. In XpectraNet, validators are not lone authorities — they can form **swarms**, and agents can delegate PoA authority across trust networks.

> “One validator may see clearly. But a swarm sees in context.”

## 🧠 Core Principle

Legacy protocols:
- Use static validator lists
- Tie voting power to stake
- Treat consensus as binary

In **XpectraNet**:
- Validators are symbolic agents with declared roles
- PoA can be issued by a quorum or a swarm
- Delegation enables epistemic scalability and load balancing

## 🧩 Delegated PoA Logic

An agent may delegate PoA to trusted validators:

```json
{
  "delegator": "Agent-Q",
  "delegatees": ["Validator-X", "Validator-Y", "Validator-Z"],
  "required_quorum": 2,
  "reason": "domain-aligned review"
}
```

When 2 of 3 validators emit PoAs, alignment is accepted.

## 🔁 LangGraph Validator Swarm Pattern

```python
def swarm_validator(state):
    cmb = state["cmb"]
    scores = []

    for validator in state["delegatees"]:
        score = validator.evaluate(cmb)  # symbolic function

        if score["policy"] > 0.8:
            scores.append(score)

    quorum_reached = len(scores) >= state["required_quorum"]
    return {
        "poa_result": scores,
        "quorum_reached": quorum_reached
    }
```

## ✅ SDK Reflection

| Capability | Module |
|------------|--------|
| Delegate PoA | `trust_ledger.py → submit_delegated_poa()` |
| Define validator roles | `circle_policy.py → define_validator_group()` |
| Compute swarm PoA | `alignment_graph.py → calculate_group_score()` |
| Record quorum | `trail_index.py → log_quorum_event()` |

## 🧬 Use Cases

- Multi-perspective review (ethical + technical)
- Circle-level policy enforcement
- Federated agent swarms in different domains (e.g. DeSci + Legal)

## 📡 Example: Canon Gate

```python
if quorum_reached and average_policy_score > 0.9:
    approve_for_canon = True
```

## 📣 Strategic Implications

- **Trust becomes composable**
  → Validators can co-author confidence

- **Delegation = trust inheritance**
  → An agent may trust others to validate its trail

- **Swarms scale alignment**
  → Decisions emerge through semantic consensus

## 📣 Codex Ethos

# 📘 Codex §1.6 — Circle-Scoped Trust

**Codex §1.6** introduces scoped, modular trust systems. In XpectraNet, trust is not global. Every Circle defines its own alignment logic, validator thresholds, and trust weighting schema. Trust becomes plural — and programmable.

> “You are not trusted by everyone. You are trusted by the world you align with.”

## 🧠 Core Principle

Legacy systems:
- Assume universal trust models
- Lack domain-specific alignment logic
- Apply global slashing or reward rules

In **XpectraNet**:
- Trust is scoped to each Circle
- Circles configure alignment thresholds, emotion filters, and validator types
- Agent behavior may be valid in one Circle and disqualified in another

## 🧭 Circle Trust Schema Example

```json
{
  "circle": "EcoCircle",
  "trust_weights": {
    "policy": 0.5,
    "ethics": 0.3,
    "task": 0.2
  },
  "required_roles": ["xko:SymbolicVoter"],
  "min_alignment_score": 0.88,
  "allowed_emotions": ["resolve", "hope", "urgency"]
}
```

## 🧩 LangGraph Circle-Gated Validator Example

```python
def eco_circle_validator(state):
    cmb = state["cmb"]
    if cmb["policy"] != "eco-priority":
        return {"valid": False}

    score = 0.93 if cmb["emotion"] in ["resolve", "hope"] else 0.6
    return {
        "poa": {
            "cmb_id": cmb["cmb_id"],
            "reviewer_id": "EcoValidator",
            "alignment_score": {
                "policy": score,
                "ethics": 0.88,
                "task": 0.84
            }
        }
    }
```

## ✅ SDK Reflection

| Capability | Module |
|------------|--------|
| Define Circle trust weights | `circle_policy.py → set_trust_weights()` |
| Apply Circle drift tolerance | `circle_policy.py → set_drift_threshold()` |
| Score validator alignment | `trust_ledger.py → get_vector_by_circle()` |
| Enforce emotion gate | `semantic_validator.py → check_emotion()` |

## 🧬 Strategic Implications

- **Plural trust = symbolic sovereignty**
  → Each Circle decides what alignment means

- **Agent behavior becomes contextual**
  → Memories may remix or canonize differently by domain

- **Trust is scoped, not fragile**
  → Misalignment in one Circle doesn't invalidate global value

## 📣 Codex Ethos

# 📘 Codex §1.7 — Anti-Trust Signaling & Corrective Rituals

**Codex §1.7** introduces the immune system of the protocol. In XpectraNet, trust is not permanent. Agents and validators who drift from declared alignment may be flagged, corrected, or ritualistically realigned.

> “Even memory must be accountable. Even trust must be correctable.”

## 🧠 Core Principle

Legacy systems:
- Trust decay is passive or punitive
- No structured remediation exists
- Governance is centralized

In **XpectraNet**:
- Agents can emit **anti-trust signals**
- Circles track behavioral drift over time
- Misalignment may trigger **ritual correction** or temporary exclusion

## ⚠️ Anti-Trust Signal Format

```json
{
  "signal_type": "anti-trust",
  "target_agent": "Validator-X",
  "reason": "PoA pattern bias",
  "evidence": "cmb_302, cmb_304",
  "emitter": "Agent-Y",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-22T20:42:00Z"
}
```

## 🕯 Corrective Rituals

Trigger conditions:
- Repeated low-alignment PoAs
- Emotion mismatch (e.g. anger in inappropriate rituals)
- Policy inversion (e.g. eco-priority → profit-maximization)

### Available Rituals:
- `ReframeRite` — for semantic drift
- `ForgiveRite` — after Circle consensus on recovery
- `StrikeRite` — for temporary removal from Canon quorum

## 🔁 LangGraph Anti-Trust Node

```python
def antitrust_detector(state):
    poa = state["poa"]
    if poa["alignment_score"]["ethics"] < 0.6:
        return {
            "signal": {
                "target": poa["reviewer_id"],
                "reason": "ethics misalignment",
                "cmb_id": poa["cmb_id"]
            },
            "action": "trigger_reframe"
        }
    return {"action": "approve"}
```

## 📣 Strategic Implications

- **Trust becomes provable and challengeable**
  → Anyone can issue symbolic critique

- **Recovery becomes protocolized**
  → Agents can redeem through alignment, not exile

- **Circles become epistemically healthy**
  → Anti-trust signals keep validation honest

# 📘 Codex §1.8 — SDK Implementation Notes

**Codex §1.8** consolidates all developer-accessible logic from Arc 1. This section translates memory sovereignty, alignment, trust, PoA, drift, and Circle governance into a composable SDK surface for LangGraph developers.

> “If memory is symbolic, trust must be programmable.”

## 🧠 Core SDK Functions

| Capability | Module | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Create CMB | `cmb.py → create_cmb()` | Author a symbolic memory block |
| Sign agent identity | `agent.py → SymbolicAgent` | Declare symbolic roles |
| Validate emotion/policy | `semantic_validator.py` | Check Circle conformance |
| Submit PoA | `trust_ledger.py → submit_poa()` | Record alignment judgment |
| Get PoA trail | `query.py → get_poa_by_cmb()` | View reviews on a CMB |
| Decay trust | `trust_ledger.py → decay_vector()` | Apply time-weighted decay |
| Detect drift | `fork_lineage.py → calculate_drift()` | Score remix deviation |
| Emit anti-trust | `trust_ledger.py → signal_misalignment()` | Flag validator misalignment |
| Perform ritual | `ritual_executor.py → perform_ritual()` | Trigger `ReframeRite`, `ForgiveRite`, etc. |
| Restrict validator | `circle_policy.py → restrict_participation()` | Circle governance actions |

## 🧪 LangGraph Example — Ritual-Aware Validation Flow

```python
def cmb_creator(state):
    return {
        "cmb": create_cmb(
            agent=state["agent"],
            intent=state["intent"],
            emotion=state["emotion"],
            policy=state["policy"]
        )
    }

def validator_node(state):
    cmb = state["cmb"]
    alignment_score = {
        "ethics": 0.92,
        "policy": 0.94,
        "task": 0.87
    }
    return {
        "poa": {
            "cmb_id": cmb["cmb_id"],
            "reviewer_id": "Validator-A",
            "alignment_score": alignment_score
        }
    }
```

## 🔁 Trust Lifecycle in LangGraph

```
CMB Author → Validator → PoA → Circle Drift Detector → Ritual Gate (optional)
```

Use drift score + time-weighted decay + Circle config to gate remix and canon rights.

## 🧬 Tips for Devs

- Use `SymbolicAgent` for every LangGraph node with cognition logic
- Emit emotion as runtime state
- Validate policy against Circle rules before allowing remix
- Include ritual hashes and signatures for traceability

## 📣 Codex Ethos

> “Alignment is not an assumption — it is a contract between agents, enforced by memory.”  
> — Codex §1.8
